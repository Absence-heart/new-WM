I am looking forward to someone who can help me to make this project perfect. Though, the main features are functioning well, there are still some bugs exist.And vuex is really hard to get through, welcome to discuss it with me, for I just start to learn all this things a few months ago, before that, I am totally a noob. Thanks to DUYi EDUCATION.

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
